Fortunately, there are plenty of no-cost resources available to help design products for print, the screen and web. While not a comprehensive list, these are a few sites to consider when choosing signature fonts, designing a unique color scheme and for creating graphics.</h4>

            <p class="lead">A good font can make a design product shine. You don't have to use only the fonts that come standard on word processing programs or those which are pre-loaded on your computer. It's very easy to install fonts and you'll be happy you did once you see some of the nice character sets that are out there.</p>

            <p class="lead">Colors make everything more interesting to look at. Especially if you're designing for a screen, where you don't need to worry about someone printing in black and white, use color! You probably learned the basics of color theory back in primary school, but there are a few useful sites on the web that mathematically manipulate the color spectrum to make your life easier.</p>

It even allows users to download Photoshop swatch files for quick integation into <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe programs</a>. Dribbble is also just a great place to search if you're looking for new design ideas. There are some incredibly talented designers on the site.</p>

            <h2>Graphics</h2>
            <p class="lead">Graphics are probably the trickiest of the design components to master. So whether it's creating your own from scratch or downloading some icon sets and mixing it with your own text and colors, they can add visual appeal to your design and convey your key point in a matter of seconds.</p>

                  <p>The Noun Project is exactly what it sounds like: a project to make simple vector graphics of nouns. While you'll need to make an account, it is a great place to find graphics of people, places, things and ideas. You'll find that most things you want to make into an icon have already been done and are available to you for free (provided you credit the designer).</p>

                  <h3><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></h3>
                  <p>Inkscape is a free and open source vector editing software. It allows you to edit PDF, SVG and Adobe Illustrator files. While it lacks some of the functionality of Illustrator, it can perform most, if not all, of the tasks you're probably looking to accomplish. For example, if you export a map as an SVG from a GIS software platform, you can pick it up in Inkscape and create a map-based infographic.</p>

                  <p>Canva is a graphic template editing platform based on the web for the creation of quick graphics and print material. You'll need to make an account, but if you're looking to make a flyer, brochure, certificate or infographic, it can be a quick way to make something that looks very nice in a short time.</p>
